# UFOs
Bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page

Data Source: ufo_starterCode.js and index.html

Data Tools: JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB

Software: MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to begin the journey of learning JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and vizualization. The project incorparates analysing to help Dana to create a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 

Initially we used a storyboard to help design for the website to have an idea of what the readers will see when they view the final product. Onced we organized to our liking we were prepared to begin coding using javascript and importing the data, later referencing it with a variable.]

1)Once the information is typed in and button is clicked.

2)The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter". 

3)Looping through the dataset will occur and keep only the results that match the search criteria will happen.

## Summary: 

One drawback of this new design would be we are limited to the pre collected data and if there is a certain town you are looking for, unfortunately it might not be found. My two recommendations for further development would be to create a database thats scrapes the entire internet that could be pulled from when you click the button. The next recommendation would be to have a interactive map to see where all the interaction occured.
