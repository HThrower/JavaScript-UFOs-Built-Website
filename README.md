# UFOs
bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page
Data Source: ufo_starterCode.js and index.html

Data Tools: JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB

Software: MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to begin the journey of learning JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and vizualization. The project incorparates analysing to help Dana to create a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
Initially we used a storyboard to help design for the website to have an idea of what the readers will see when they view the final product. Onced we organized to our liking we were prepared to begin coding using javascript and importing the data, later referencing it with a variable.]

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development
